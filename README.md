# turtle-graphics

Turtle is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw in a screen. 

There is a turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane. We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around.

There are alot of other methods and attributes for the turtle object, which can be used to move or do certain tasks with the turtle.
